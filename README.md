R | Principal Component Analysis

**Summary:** 

The purposes of this project is to take a data set with a large amount of dimensions and reduce it as much as possible without compromising accuracy. Using regression analysis, I am able to identify the variables with a highest coefficients. From there I build 3 logistic regression models using different number of variables. Comparing the models, I find that only 3 variables are sufficient enough to produce a model with 84% accuracy.
